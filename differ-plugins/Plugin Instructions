To prepare a plugin project easily, add the following dependency to the plugins pom

<!-- Differ Plugins Include -->
<dependency>
	<groupId>cz.nkp</groupId>
	<artifactId>differ-plugins</artifactId>
	<version>1.0</version>
	<type>pom</type>
</dependency>   

and make sure that the pom is visible from your machine's maven repository. 


This will give your project the minimally needed dependencies to implement the plugin service interface.
